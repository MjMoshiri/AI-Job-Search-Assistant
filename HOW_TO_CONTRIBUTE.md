## Discussion

If you have suggestions or ideas that could improve the project beyond the points listed below, please feel free to share them. I am always open to discussing new features and potential improvements. Your insights are invaluable!

## Current Priorities

Here are some key areas where contributions are particularly welcome:

1. **Decoding All Hardcoded Parts**: Remove hardcoded values and replace them with configurable options. This will make the system more flexible and easier to adapt for different users' needs.

2. **Setting Up a Database Migration System**: Implement a system for managing database changes and migrations. This will facilitate the upgrade and maintenance of the database as the project grows.

3. **Rewriting the API (Possibly Adding Swagger)**: Improve the existing API by rewriting it to enhance its performance and maintainability. Adding Swagger documentation could greatly improve how developers interact with the API, making it more accessible and easier to use.

4. **Centralizing the Deployment Process**: Simplify the deployment process to enable users with minimal technical expertise to set up and use the application. This could involve creating scripts, improving documentation, or developing new tools that automate the deployment.
